%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography

%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,

\section{Introduction}
ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and
incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.

%%
%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
% \begin{acks}
% To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
% \end{acks}

%%
%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
% \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
% \bibliography{sample-base}

% %%
% %% If your work has an appendix, this is the place to put it.
% \appendix
